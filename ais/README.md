# AIS

_"The automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services (VTS). When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport."_ â€” [Automatic Identification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system)
