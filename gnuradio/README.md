# GNURadio Live Environment

_"Creating a bootable USB drive with the Live SDR Environment on it takes more effort, but results in a GNU Radio development environment that can be extended and have work saved across multiple sessions. This is useful to avoid having to modify existing operating system installations and software configurations on a PC or laptop."_ - [Johnathan Corgan](https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/using-gnu-radio-live-sdr-environment/)

The Live Environment has a small number of shortcuts available through the desktop and sidebar.

The GNU Radio Companion is accessible by clicking the GNU Radio logo on either the left side launchbar or the desktop, or by opening a terminal window and entering grc.

A terminal window may be opened by clicking on the terminal icon on the left or by typing Ctrl-Alt-T.

The GNU Radio documentation maybe opened in the Firefox browser by clicking the documentation link on the desktop.

A local copy of the online GNU Radio Tutorials may be opened in the Firefox browser by clicking the tutorial link on the desktop.

A shortcut to all of the GNU Radio examples is in the live user home directory under ‘examples’. You can navigate there from a terminal to run the Python scripts, or from the File|Open menu inside the GNU Radio companion.
