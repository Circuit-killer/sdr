The [PortaPack H1](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf) attaches to your HackRF and adds a touchscreen LCD, navigation controls, headphone jack, real-time clock, micro SD card slot, and custom aluminum case.

Just add a USB battery, and you're ready to explore radio spectrum wherever you are. The PortaPack firmware runs on the fast ARM processors in your HackRF. No computer is necessary (except for reprogramming firmware).

## Havock

[HAVOC](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc) is a fork of the PortaPack H1 firmware, a portability add-on for the HackRF One software-defined radio.

It is build on top of ShareBrained's firmware, meaning that the original functionalities are kept (except when I don't sync for 2 months).
